This program takes in input from the command line to process 5 page replacement algorithms.

To run this program I used the terminal in linux with the following command from the directory the file named main.c is located:

gcc -o a main.c

Then ran the command in the terminal the integers should have single spaces between them, the first number is the number of frames
the rest of the numbers are the pages:

./a 3 0 1 5 5 5 0 2 3 4 1 1 9 9 10 0 2 1

The program will run and you have the choice to select any of the 5 algorithms until you choose to exit. FIFO,OPTIMAL,LRU,LFU,MFU.
